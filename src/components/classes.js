            <p>
              Our 60 minute class is high intensity training at it’s finest.
              Workouts combine a variety of functional movements - everything
              from cardio and gymnastics to power lifting and Olympic lifting.
              Our coaches will guide you through weight training and/or cardio
              exercises. Every workout can be safely scaled for beginning,
              intermediate, and advanced athletes.

            <p>
              Our Pump & Burn classes are a great alternative or supplement to
              F60. It's a one-hour class of equal amounts of strength
              training (Pump) and conditioning (Burn). PUMP is a total body
              workout that builds solid, lean muscle. An expert trainer will
              guide you through movements that utilize dumbbells, kettlebells,
              and your own bodyweight. BURN is a high-energy cardio workout that
              will get your heart rate up and keep it there.
